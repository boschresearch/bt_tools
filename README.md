There are 3 tools to view behavior trees:

## btlib

A Library to parse behavior trees.

### How to generate fbl files

To analyze past runs of a behavior tree, you need to enable the logging to fbl files. This is a feature of the BehaviorTree.CPP library but for example navigation2 does currently not support it.
You can enable the support like this: <https://github.com/ct2034/navigation2/commit/b019fbc49d72dd34a45128bb20d1114e9b8c2b24>

## bt_live

Look at the behavior tree at runtime

### Usage

The tool currently requires an `fbl` log file, because it contains the tree definition.
But it will then visualize the tree at runtime based on the messages published unter `/behavior_tree_log`.

```bash
ros2 run bt_live bt_live --ros-args -p fbl_file:=<path_to_fbl_log>
```

Then open a browser at <http://localhost:8000> to see the visualization.
It should look a little something like this:

<img src="bt_live/doc/bt_live_browser.png" width="600" />

## bt_view

Tools to visualize and analyze past behavior tree runs.

### Visualizing a `fbl` log

```bash
ros2 run bt_view bt_view --bt_log_fbl_fnames <path_to_fbl_log>
```

The tool will output images about

- the count of calls with the suffix `_count.png` and
- the return states with the suffix `_states.png`
to the same folder that the `fbl` log is in.

For example, the `_states.png` file will look like this:

<img src="bt_view/test/_test_data/reference/bt_trace_other_fbl_log_states.png" width="600" />

### Calculate coverage

```bash
ros2 run bt_view bt_view --bt_log_fbl_fnames <path_to_fbl_log> --coverage-threshold <threshold>
```

The tool will count the percentage of nodes that have been executed in the giben fbl file(s). Iff above the threshold, it will return 0.
